				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hi everyone, this is my portfolio page I created as a capstone project for <u><a href="">Web Design For Everybody</a></u>, an online course by the University of Michigan.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering. I also did my Bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan and picked up a minor in Computer Science.</p>
	<p>I am chiefly interested in the following topics:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Simulation</li>
			<li>Internet-Of-Things</li>
			<li>Automation</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>I took this course because I already had exposure to backend development through my CS minor. I elected to learn databases &#8212 how to store and access information programmatically. Learning front-end development complements my prior experience nicely and pushes me one step closer to becoming a full-stack developer!</p>
		<p>Additionally, the choice of Web as a front-end makes the most sense in a cloud-first world. Everyone is moving toward Web UIs as a platform-agnostic solution to producing consistent and flexible interfaces. All a computer needs to be able to do nowadays to complete 99% of common tasks is to just run a web browser!</p>
		<h2>This Portfolio</h2>
		<p>I talk about 2 different projects I have worked on in the past in this portfolio: a data logger I designed and built, and a primer on the Finite Element Method. I also have a page of "extras" that demonstrates some advanced web functionality. I hope you like it.</p>
