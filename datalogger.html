                    <p>I came across a visiting professor, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shane-Johnson-3">Dr Shane Johnson</a>, who teaches at the <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, who was describing a problem he needed help with. Shane specializes in the field of simulation, and wanted to simulate cardboard boxes and the kinds of forces they experienced as they were being shipped from warehouses to consumers.</p>

                    <p>The practical reason for this is that packaging engineers have to select materials and design packaging to protect the goods contained within. There exist standard tests that can be used to certify that a package meets minimum standards of protection, but nobody has investigated if the standard itself accurately reflects the conditions that packaging goes through in real life. Furthermore, understanding the conditions a package needs to withstand can help packaging engineers optimize their designs to save on packaging costs and minimize product damage.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I offered to help build a battery-powered data logger that could be placed in a package and would measure the forces it experienced while being shipped. I took this as an opportunity to teach myself hobby electronics and learn to put together a complete hardware package. The steps involved were:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Selecting Components</li>
                    <li>Prototyping on a breadboard</li>
                    <li>Writing firmware</li>
                    <li>Laying out schematics for a Printed Circuit Board</li>
                    <li>Getting PCBs manufactured and debugging</li>
